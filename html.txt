Run api app.js.
In folder, code/html.
When the map.html is opened we see the map of the ECE, the university of Patras facility.
We see various icons above with the values that are in the database at that moment.
For the buttons to work, we press the button and then refresh to accept the data.
The same applies to increasing the illumination on each individual light.
With the RESET button all values from lights and motion detectors become 0.
Scenario 1: Suppose we have a motion in motion 1, and that the ambient lighting is low,
so they have to turn on the lights up to 0.5 of the brightness.
Scenario 2 (no need to refresh): Even if a light turns out to have a fault, it is highlighted on the paper
with a red circle and gives us the indication "not ok".
